### Python Workflow

This folder contains demonstrators for all the steps of the VOTable annotation process.

We show how to stack measurement mapping blocks with CAB-MSD in a real VOTable

The data file is a subset of 4th XMM catalog  

1. `mapping_factory` : Generation of generic mapping blocks for the models components

2. `product_annoter` : Insertion of mapping blocks in a real VOTable

3. `client` : VOTable reader using annotations
