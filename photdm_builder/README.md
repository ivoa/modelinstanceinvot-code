# PhotDM serialization generation

The `fps_converter.py` script generates a set of PhotDM instances named `photdm*.xml`
- It iterates over an hard-coded list of filter ids (WISE, GAIA and 2MASS)
- It generates for each a serialization saved in one specific file.

The files for XMM Filters have been generated by hand from the same template.

The PhotDM serialization can be integrated as such in the GLOBALS section of the MIVOT mapping.

As there is one file per filter, the PhotometricSystem objects contain only one filter. 
The merge of several filters in one file is straightforward by the way.

**Important note**: Work in progress :
The serialization builder is not yet fully in sync with PhotDM1.1 ; some PhotDM instance tweaks might be needed.
