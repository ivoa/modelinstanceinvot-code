# PhotDM serialization generation

The `fps_converter.py` script generates a set of PhotDM instances named `photdm*.xml`
- It iterates over an hard-coded list of filter ids (WISE, GAIA and 2MASS)
- It generates for each a serialization saved in one specific file.

The XMM files have been generated by hand from the same template.

The PhotDM serialization can intergrated as such in mapping GLOBALS.

As there is one file per filter, the PhotometricSystem objects contain only one filter. 
The merge of several filters in one file is staightforward by the way.
